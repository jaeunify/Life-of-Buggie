# Life-of-Buggie - An Adventure 2D Top-down RPG Game

- Story:
  This is my solo-made game (so far) about a girl named Buggie who lives an ordinary life until her city encountered giant portals that spawns mythical monsters. This    incident happened a long time ago and the city council has already made a special task force comprises of humans with supernatural power to clear out those portals. 

  She woke up one day to find herself awoken with a mysterious power that gives her godly strength, speed, and a level up system that no one have. From there on, she starts her adventure to help the city clear out those monster portals and uncovers the secret behind this phenomenon.
