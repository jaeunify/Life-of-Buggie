# Life-of-Buggie - An Adventure 2D Top-down RPG Game

## Story:
 This is my solo-made game (so far) about a girl named Buggie who lives an ordinary life until her city encountered giant portals that spawns mythical monsters. This    incident happened a long time ago and the city council has already made a special task force comprises of humans with supernatural power to clear out those portals.
 
 She woke up one day to find herself awoken with a mysterious power that gives her godly strength, speed, and a level up system that no one have. From there on, she starts her adventure to help the city clear out those monster portals and uncovers the secret behind this phenomenon. 
  
## Development (so far):
  - Already finished developing the world design for the first chapter of the story, which is also the place where a major part of our story will take place. 
  - Created many NPCs, and basic AI for enemy that is able to hit, chase down the character, and take hit.
  - Developed basic character movement where player can controler the character to move and combat.
  
## Future plan:
> This project is open for anyone who wants to contribute or just want to have fun and learn new things.

> This game will eventually be published on market for free/sale depends on the situation. I started this project not to profit from sales but only for the love of RPG gaming, story-telling, and just to create something that I am proud of.

> I am willing to spend years to complete and finesse this game. Anyone who have similar mindset are always welcome to join, whether it is the game art, world/quest/level designing, or coding AI behavior, etc.

**With that being said, here are my future development for the game:**
  - Dungeons/realms where player can fight, earn experience, hunt for items, and basically get stronger.
  - Challenging bosses, arch enemies, and mobs/monsters.
  - A decision tree where player is allowed to make decision as they progress through the story which will impact the outcome or even end the game.
  - **Game Art** as all the art I used in this game so far are from the Internet.
  - A complete inventory and items system.
  - A health and/or mana system.
  - Gameplay music.
